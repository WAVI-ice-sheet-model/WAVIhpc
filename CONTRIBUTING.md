# Contributing to model-ensembler
Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit
helps, and credit will always be given.

## Types of Contributions

You can contribute in many ways:

### Open an Issue
Open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/alextbradley/WAVIhpc).

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup, or HPC platform that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Implement Features
Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation
The `WAVIhpc` documentation can always be improved, please feel encouraged to use the "edit this page on Github" feature.

### Add new cases
Adding further test cases, in addition to MISMIP, MISOMIP etc. would be very welcome, and enable others to easily run your WAVI ensembling scenarios.

### Adding new platforms
Contributing to `scripts/` to enable the templating of cases and running of ensembles on additional HPC clusters would be very welcome. Ideally, stay consistent with the symlinking approach from local to minimise the maintenance effort of supporting different platforms.

### Submit Feedback
The best way to send feedback is to [open an issue](https://github.com/alextbradley/WAVIhpc).

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome.
